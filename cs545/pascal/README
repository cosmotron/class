Pascal Compiler
--------------------

0. Building and Running:
   * Note: This was tested in Mac OS X 10.6.7 with GCC 4.2.1
           I couldn't get the assembly to work in x86 Ubuntu... maybe you'll
           have better luck?
   * Note: There are two debug flags that can be enabled in the Makefile:
     ** PRINT_SYNTAX_TREE: will print the syntax tree for each BEGIN-END block
     ** PRINT_SYMBOL_TABLE: will print the symbol table in each scope
   - run `make`
   - run `./pascal < program.p > output.s`

1. Test Files:
   - In test_files folder
     - ifthen.p: tests if-then-else support, nested statments, write()
     - example.p: tests function calls, expressions, write()
     - boo.p: the sample file that you made when I was demoing it for you
   - *.s files in there are example assembly output in case it doesn't compile

2. Limitations:
   - No loop support
   - No real support
   - No array (int or real) support
   - No non-local access
   - No expr_gencode() panic mode support
   - No read (scanf) support
   - Saving register states will save all values of all registers,not just
     those that were used.
   - Maximum number of scopes is static (upper bound of 10), not dynamic
